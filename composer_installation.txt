Installation
1.1 Back-up
We strongly advise to install and update the extension on a staging environment first and make a back-up of your webshop prior to the installation.

1.2 Composer installation
Login via SSH and execute the following commands via the command line:

composer require buckaroo/magento2
1.3 Extension activation and updates
Execute the following commands via the command line:

php bin/magento module:enable Buckaroo_Magento2
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
1.4 File access rights
Depending on the operating system, make sure the just added files have the correct access rights so that the web server can access and execute the files correctly.

The composer command can be executed by the logged in user on the server which is sometimes not the same as the user of the web server. The files created by composer can not be read by the web server which can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Composer will install the files in:

vendor/buckaroo/magento2
1.5 Remove static files
Depending on your webshop configuration, empty following static files directories:

pub/static/frontend/
pub/static/adminhtml/
pub/static/_requirejs/
1.6 Flush cache and reindex
Flush your Magento cache using the following command:

php bin/magento cache:flush
Depending on your configuration, make sure the following directories are emptied:

var/cache
var/pagecache
var/generation
var/di (if this folder exists)
Execute the following command via the command line to force a re-index:

php bin/magento indexer:reindex
The installation is now completed.

Update
2.1 Update the extension
To be able to make use of the latest features and bugfixes you should update the extension frequently. To do this you have to execute the following commands and flush your Magento cache.

composer update buckaroo/magento2
php bin/magento setup:upgrade

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you update from v1.14.1 or lower to v1.15.2 then you need to take specific actions instead :

composer require buckaroo/magento2:1.15.2
composer remove tig/buckaroo
php bin/magento setup:upgrade

IMPORTANT NOTE: if you update from v1.14.1 or lower to v1.16.0 or higher then you need to take specific actions instead :

php bin/magento module:disable TIG_Buckaroo
composer remove tig/buckaroo
composer require buckaroo/magento2
php bin/magento module:enable Buckaroo_Magento2
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
